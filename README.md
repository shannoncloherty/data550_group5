## Initial code description

`alex/code/01_table1.R`
  - makes table 1
  - saves table 1 as a `.rds` object in `alex/output/`

`erika/code/02_boxplots.R`
  - makes boxplots for MUAC, weight, and height
  - saves the boxplots as `.png` objects in `erika/output/`

`erika/code/03_barchart_oedema.R`
  - makes a barchart for oedema
  - saves the barchart as a `.png` object in `erika/output`

`tina/code/04_regression_figure1.R`
  - runs a regression analysis where days to stabilization is the outcome and 
    treatment arm is the main predictor
  - creates a figure that describes the model and saves it as a `.rds` object
    in `tina/output/`
  
`tina/code/05_regression_figure2.R`
  - creates a scatterplot with the regression line
  - saves the scatterplot as a `.rds` object in `tina/output/`
  
`afia/code/06_breastfeeding_table.R`
  - creates a summary table stratifying by breastfeeding status
  - saves the table as a `.rds` object in `afia/output/`
  
`afia/code/07_breastfeeding_graph.R`
  - creates a side by side boxplot of days to stabilization by breastfeeding
    status
  - saves the figure as a `.rds` object in `afia/output/`
  
`afia/code/08_treatment_table.R`
  - creates a summary table stratifying by treatment arm
  - saves the table as a `.rds` object in `afia/output/`
  
`afia/code/09_treatment_graph.R`
  - creates a side by side boxplot of days to stabilization by treatment arm
  - saves the figure as a `.rds` object in `afia/output/`
